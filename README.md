+ Job Board

-ruby 2.0.0
-rails 4.1.0
-nokogiri


###Project was to scrape job boards using nokogiri. I found that nokogiri does not scrape iframes, which many individual companies use to display their open-positions.  
###This made it difficult for me to scrape their site, so I decided to scrape job boards instead. This was a much easier task. Check out the Company.rb file to see how I implemented this task.
